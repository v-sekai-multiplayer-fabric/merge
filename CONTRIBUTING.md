This repo assembles the multiplayer-fabric Godot fork from upstream
feature branches and pushes the result back to
`v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric/godot`.  Three files do the work:

- `update_godot_v_sekai.exs` is the Elixir driver.  It must be run
  from `main`, sets up the `v-sekai-multiplayer-fabric` and
  `opentelemetry-godot` remotes, invokes the assembler, and (unless
  `--dry-run` is passed) force-pushes the assembled
  `multiplayer-fabric-base` and `multiplayer-fabric` branches plus a
  CalVer tag.
- `thirdparty/git-assembler` is a vendored copy of git-assembler 1.5,
  a single Python 3 file (GPLv3).  It reads `gitassembly` and performs
  the actual branch stage/merge operations.
- `gitassembly` is the configuration.  It lists upstream refs to
  assemble, one operation per line.

## Workflow

Iterate with `--dry-run` so the script doesn't push:

```
elixir update_godot_v_sekai.exs --dry-run
```

Publish a release (force-push plus tag) by dropping the flag:

```
elixir update_godot_v_sekai.exs
```

You can also invoke the assembler directly.  This skips the Elixir
wrapper's remote setup, stash, and push, so both remotes must already
be fetched:

```
python3 ./thirdparty/git-assembler -av --recreate --config gitassembly
```

Uncommitted changes are stashed at the start of the run and reported
at the end.

## How the assembler behaves

Running the assembler twice with the same inputs produces the same
tree; the only thing that changes between runs is the timestamped tag.
If a step turns out to be non-deterministic, fix it before merging
rather than working around it.

Branch lists belong in `gitassembly`, not in the Elixir or Python
source.  Adding a new upstream means adding a `merge` line, not
editing the wrapper.

`--dry-run` only suppresses the push and tag steps.  The wrapper still
stashes, force-checks out `main`, deletes the local
`multiplayer-fabric-base` and `multiplayer-fabric` branches, and
recreates them via `--recreate`.  Do not pass `--dry-run` expecting
nothing to happen locally.

Conflict resolution is plain `git merge`.  `gitassembly` declares no
`ours`/`theirs`/custom merge drivers, and `git-assembler` does not
support cherry-picking, so a conflict fails the run and the fix
belongs on the source branch.

Neither script should exit non-zero silently.  In the Elixir wrapper
the `run!` helper raises with the failing command and exit code; in
the assembler, errors go through `logging.error`.

## Updating the vendored assembler

`thirdparty/git-assembler` is a single file, not a submodule and not
a directory.  Its version lives in `APP_VER` inside the script
(currently `1.5`).  To update: replace the file with a newer upstream
copy, adjust `APP_VER` to match, and verify the CLI flags the Elixir
wrapper depends on (`-av`, `--recreate`, `--config`) still exist.

## Tag format

The release tag is built from the current UTC time:

```
v<YYYY.MM.DD.HHMM>-multiplayer-fabric
```

There is no Godot version string read from `.env` or the command
line.  The assembled tree's Godot version is whatever the first
`stage` line in `gitassembly` points at (currently `feat/engine-misc`).
To pin a different upstream version, change that ref.
